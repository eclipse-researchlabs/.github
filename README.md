# Eclipse Research Labs

Eclipse Research Labs is a community of open source research projects that build technology based on 
the Eclipse platform. It provides the infrastructure services typically required by 
open source projects, such as code repositories, bug tracking, project web sites/wiki. 

Eclipse Research Labs projects are not official Eclipse Foundation projects. Eclipse Labs 
projects are not hosted by the Eclipse Foundation and do not have to follow the 
Eclipse Foundation development and intellectual property policies.

There are a number of things Eclipse Research Labs projects can not do since they are not 
official Eclipse Foundation projects, including 1) include the word Eclipse in their name, 
2) use the org.eclipse namespace for their bundles names, or 3) participate in the 
annual Eclipse release trains, unless they are included in an official Eclipse project.

Eclipse Research Labs has lots of in common with [Eclipse Labs](https://github.com/eclipselabs/eclipselabs).
It addresses the same need: Provide a landing infrastructure for Research projects without the constrains attached 
to an official Eclipse Foundation projects and with the goal, at some point, to produce one or more Eclipse Foundation projects.
Eclipse Research Labs has a lot in common with [Eclipse Labs] (https://github.com/eclipselabs/eclipselabs).
It meets the same needs: 
(1) To provide a landing infrastructure for research projects while minimizing the IP constraints of the Eclipse Foundation's official projects and 
(2) To eventually allow to produce one or more projects of the Eclipse Foundation. For this reason we recommend projects
to track contributions by asking their contributor to sign the Eclipse Contribor Agreement. It will faciliate the transfer to an official Eclipse FOundation project later on.
